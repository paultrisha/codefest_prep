# CodefestPrep

The webapp is created as a part of Codefest 2021 Preparatory task. The webapp is a simple app created with Webex SDKs which allow the user to do the following:
* Login to webex
* Create a webex space/room
* Add memeber to the selected space
* Send a message to the selected space
* Logout

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

Run `ng generate service service-name` to generate a new service.
